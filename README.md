🚦 TrafficBrain-AI
Real-Time Traffic Analysis, Speed Violation & Smart Enforcement System using YOLOv11

📌 Overview

TrafficBrain-AI is an intelligent real-time traffic monitoring system powered by YOLOv11 object detection that not only analyzes traffic but also enforces rules digitally.

It performs:

Vehicle detection & classification
Smart vehicle counting
Speed estimation & violation detection
Automated challan (e-challan) generation
Road usage distribution analysis
Interactive analytics dashboard

🎯 Key Features

✅ Real-Time Object Detection
Uses YOLOv11s for fast, accurate detection
Detects multiple vehicles simultaneously

✅ Vehicle Classification
🚗 Cars
🏍️ Motorcycles
🚛 Trucks
🚌 Buses

✅ Vehicle Counting System

Counts vehicles crossing a predefined line
Maintains:
Class-wise count
Total vehicle count

✅ Speed Estimation

Tracks object movement across frames
Estimates relative vehicle speed in real-time

🚨 Speed Violation Detection

Threshold-based logic
Color-coded alerts:
🟢 Safe
🔴 Violation

🧾 Challan (E-Ticketing) System 

Automatically generates challans for violating vehicles
Stores:
Vehicle type
Speed
Timestamp

🛣️ Road Distribution Analysis

Shows traffic composition:
% of cars vs bikes vs trucks vs buses
Useful for traffic planning & optimization

📊 Dashboard & Output

results.json → raw data
dashboard_combined.html → visualization

Displays:

Vehicle distribution
Violations
Traffic patterns
